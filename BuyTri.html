                        <h1>Visit my Buy Tri Website</h1>
                    </a>
                    <p>Buy Tri Inc is a fictitious webpage that I created with the intent to buy and sell Tricycles in the local Raleigh NC area. For this project I had to code everything that you see from the layout, to images inserted, even little details such as link and text colors . The logo in the top left corner was something that I also made myself through Adobe Photoshop, I wanted to give a personal touch to the site. If you take the time to look through the you will see pages including a place to buy the company’s tricycles and a place where Buy Tri offers a price matching option.</p>
