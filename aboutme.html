                    <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello! My name is Imani Haskell. I've been passionate about drawing and creativity for as long as I can remember. From doodling as a child to exploring all things artsy and crafty, artistic expression has always been part of who I am.</p>
            
            <p>I'm currently finishing my Associate's degree in Advanced Graphic Design and Advertising. While traditional art comes naturally to me, my journey has expanded into the digital world—learning graphic design, web design, and even coding, which I never imagined I'd enjoy. These new skills have opened up exciting opportunities I hadn’t considered before.</p>
            
            <p>So far, I’ve completed a few commission pieces and was honored to create a design for an elementary school. These experiences have pushed me to grow and improve professionally.</p>
            
            <p>I’m now actively seeking opportunities in the design field—especially in graphic design—that will help me continue learning and developing my craft. I’m excited about what lies ahead!</p>
